## Motivation:
- The purpose of this project is to combine and use all concepts we have learned in CS so far in Y1 Summer!  
- It is also your **first opportunity** to build an **application** using the **Input/Output** concept!

## User Experience (UI)
- User experience is as important as writing your code!
    - Is your app enjoyable/intuitive/easy to use?
    - Why should users choose your calculator over any other calculator application?
    - What about your application that makes it extra useful/enjoyable and adds value to it?

- To build a great application requires **empathy**... put yourself in the shoes of the user while building it!

## Objectives:
1. The Basic 4: 
    - Create a calculator that has at least the basic 4 symbols (Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), and Division(/)) 
    - The calculator has to take at least 2 numbers and 1 of the symbols in order to create an equation 
    - The calculator has to return the value of the given equation 
2. Exponents 
3. Error Handling 
4. Menu:
    - Include a menu of operations/actions options that is displayed when your application starts running.
5. Run Continuously:
    - The program must run **continuously** until the user decides to stop/exit the application.


## Challenges: *(Extra)*
1. Take more than two number!
2. Take more than one symbol, and make sure that you calculate the right order of operations. 
3. Add a history of operations list/dictionary!
4. Show the calculator results using turtle! 

## Go Crazy: *(Extra)*
1. Full Functional Graphics! (Turtle)
    - Something that looks like this:
