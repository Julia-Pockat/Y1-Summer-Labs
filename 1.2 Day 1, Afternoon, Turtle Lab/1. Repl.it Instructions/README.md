## Repl.it Setup:
* First, we'll need to set up our **Repl.it** environment:
    1. **Account Creation:**
        1. Go to https://Repl.it/ and click on **Sign Up** (Top-right).
        1. Fill in your username, email, and password... make sure your email is valid and accessible.
        1. After signing up, you will be asked to fill more info to complete your account, this step is optional.
        1. When done, a **verification email** will be sent to your email in 5-10 minutes, wait for it, and click on **"Verify"** when you get the email.
        1. That's it!
    1. **Environment Setup:**
        1. Click on **"+new Repl"** (Top-right): This will create a new file for you to code in!
        1. Choose "Python" as the programming language.
        1. Name your Repl **"Y1 Summer Labs"**
        1. Click on "Create Repl"
        1. Now your big folder has been created, and you can see the **Editor** and **Console** in front of you!
            - Click on "Create new folder" on the top-left, and name it **"Day 1"**
            - Click on "Create new file" (also on the top-left), and name it **"TurtleLab"**
        1. Now you can start writing your code and running it!!!
        1. Make sure each lab, and each day, you create a new folder and new files for each separate lab!
        1. We'll teach you how to submit your work later on :)



**Now we're done with setting up our programming environment, let's get to Turtle!**
