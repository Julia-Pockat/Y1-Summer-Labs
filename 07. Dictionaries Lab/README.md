# Dictionaries Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to start writing AND using **dictionaries**, and understand better on how we deal with data in computer science!

> Before we start, navigate to the Repl.it assignment associated with this lab in the Teams tab! 

## Instructions:

### 1) Recipes Book!

1. Create a **dictionary** called `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that has the following data:  
    **Key** | **Value**          
    --- | ---   
    elbow pasta | 2 cups         
    butter | 1/2 stick      
    whole milk | 1 cup     
    shredded cheddar cheese | 3 cups    

  **All of the ingredients and amounts should be strings.**

2. Use `print` to print out the **amount of cheese** from `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that is needed!

3. Use `print` to print out every ingredient and amount in the dictionary!

4. Now use `print` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts.

5. Next use `print` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. 

6. Print the number of ingredients in the `mac_and_cheese_recipe` dictionary.
     
### 2) Dictionaries in Dictionaries (Nested dictionaries)
```python
city_info = {		"new_york" : { "mayor" : "Bill DeBlasio",
							"population" : 8337000,
							"website" : "http://www.nyc.gov"
							},
			 "los_angeles" : { "mayor" : "Eric Garcetti",
							   "population" : 3884307,
							   "website" : "http://www.lacity.org"
							},
			 "miami" : { "mayor" : "Tom√°s Regalado",
					     "population" : 419777,
						 "website" : "http://www.miamigov.com"
					    },
			 "chicago" : { "mayor" : "Rahm Emanuel",
						   "population" : 2695598,
						   "website" : "http://www.cityofchicago.org/"
						}
		    }
```
1. The `city_info` dictionary above is a series of nested dictionaries. What do you think you get if you printed::
    - `city_info["los_angeles"]` ?
    - `city_info["chicago"]["mayor"]` ?

    **Print these lines of code to see if you're right!**

2. Write code to print each of these:
    - The population of New York
    - The website for Miami city government
    - The mayor of Los Angeles
    - A dictionary with all information on Chicago



### 3) Instagram Post

Your an engineer at **Instagram**, the **App development manager** asks you to create better organized Instagram *post* data structure!
The manager thinks it's really messy and un-organized, and he wants the post data stored in **dictionaries**!


1. *Define* a new dictionary, call it `instagram_post`, It should have the following keys:
    **Key** | **Value**          
    --- | ---   
    image_link | A link to the image (`string`).         
    caption | I bet you know what a caption at Instagram means!      
    Likes | should be a `list` of names (strings) of the likers.     
    Comments | should be a `list` of strings of the comments.
    - Fill the content as you wish :)

2. *Define* a new variable called `name`, which represents the name of the liker, using an **input**.
    - Write code to add `name` to `Likes` in `instagram_post` dictionary.
    - Also print `"[name] has liked your post."`

3. *Define* a new variable, `comment`, which uses an **input** to allow you to enter a comment.
    - Write code to add `comment` to `Comments` in the `instagram_post` dictionary.
    - Also print `"A follower has commented: [comment]"`
    
4. *Define* a new variable, `new_caption`, using an  **input**.
    - Write code to update `caption` accordingly in the `instagram_post` dictionary.
    - Also `print`: `"Caption has been updated."`


##### Great job!

## Wrapping up:

Run the test.
- If it passes:
    - You can go on to try the bonus problems at the bottom of the lab. Be sure you don't change any of the code you already wrote!
    - When you're done, make sure to submit the lab with the `Submit` button on the top right.
- If it fails:
    - Review the lab to see if you missed any steps. You need to follow the steps _exactly_ to pass.
    - If you have questions, ask a classmate, or call over an Instructor or TA!


## Bonus Problems:

1. Complete the previous incomplete labs (if any).


##### Great job on completing the bonus problems section!  
###### Make sure your code is saved in Repl.it
