# Dictionaries Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to start writing AND using **dictionaries**, and understand better on how we deal with data in computer science!

> Before we start, make sure to create a new file in **Repl.it** and call it **"DictLab"**!  
> And make sure to save it in **"Day 5"** Folder.  

## Instructions:

### 1) Recipes Book!

1. Create a **dictionary** called `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that has the following data:
    - elbow pasta : 2 cups
    - butter : 1/2 stick
    - whole milk : 1 cup
    - shredded cheddar cheese : 3 cups

  **All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings.**

2. Write a function that **returns** (not print) your `mac_and_cheese_recipe` dictionary


3. Write function called `amount_of_cheese` that returns the **amount of cheese** from `mac_and_cheese_recipe` that is needed!

4. Use `print` to print out every ingredient and amount in the dictionary!

5. Now use `print` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts.

6. Now use `print` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. 

7. Return the number of ingredients in the `mac_and_cheese_recipe` dictionary.
    - Create a function called `number_ingredients`, that handles this.
    
### 2) GO HOME!, Unless...  

### 3) Daily Routine Function

Homer's daily routine is:
- 8-9 Wake up
- 9-10 Brush teeth, then eat 10 donuts.
- 10-12 Run to the store and make sure you have enough donuts for lunch.
- 12-13 Donuts Lunch
- 13-15 Go to the park
- 15-19 TV Time!
- 19-20 Donuts Dinner!
- 20-24 Fall asleep while watching TV and eating donuts.

1. Write a new function called `whatToDo`, that takes 1 argument called `time`, it represents the hour.

2. Plan the function and make it so when you put in `time` while calling the function `whatToDo`, it would print Homer's task according to the daily routine plan of his!
    - For example: `whatToDo(12)` would return as an output: `Donuts Lunch`
    
3. Does it work properly? Test it out!
 
 
4. Now, ask a neighbor to write down his/her daily routine, and write a new function that does the same, but for the new routine!
    - Let your neighbor try it out!

## Bonus Problems:

#### Leap Years*
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/leap.gif" align="right" hspace="10">

1. Write a new function that takes in **two arguments** for a `starting year` and an `ending year`, and then `print` all of the **leap years** *between them* (including the starting and ending years, if they are also leap years). 

    - Hint: Leap years are years **divisible by four** (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are _not_ leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are ALSO divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000). 

Yes, it's all pretty confusing, but not as confusing as having July in the middle of the winter, which is what would eventually happen if we didn't have leap years!
