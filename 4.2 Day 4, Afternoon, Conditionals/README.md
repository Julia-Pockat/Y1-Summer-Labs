## Instructions:

### 1) Homer Diet
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/homer.gif" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> Homer Simpson has decided to go on a diet and he needs your help to stay on track. You are going to make the tests pass and help him control his donut intake.   

1. *Define* a new function called `no_donuts` that takes in a **number of donuts** as an argument. 
    - If the **number of donuts** is *greater* than **zero**, then this function should **print** `"Get back on your diet!"` 
    - Otherwise it should **print** `"Good job, Homer!"`
    
Homer's diet has been going well and we're going to cut him some slack. 
2. Write a new function called `less_donuts` that takes in a **number of donuts** as an argument
    - The function should tell Homer `"good job"` when he eats **less than *3 donuts***
    - And to `"slow down"` if he's eaten **exactly 3 donuts** 
    - And "`get back on your diet"` if he eats **more than 3 donuts**.

We've decided to give Homer a little more control over his diet.  
3. Write a function called `some_donuts` that takes in **two arguments**, the **number of donuts** he has eaten, and a **maximum donut intake**. 
    - This method should tell Homer `"good job"` if he eats **less than half his maximum intake**
    - And `"get back on your diet"` when he **exceeds his maximum intake**.


### 2) GO HOME!, Unless...

Parrots love to mimic their human companions. In this part you'll give your parrot **functions** a word or phrase as an **argument** and your parrot will take your argument, do something to it, and say then it back to you in their own quirky way.

Write the following functions according to each one's description:
1. Happy Parrot - This parrot is so happy. It accepts a 'thing' as its argument and then returns a string where it says how happy it is about the thing!  
    - Example: `happy_parrot(thing)` would return `"I am so happy about [thing]!"`

2. Math Parrot - Create a function that accepts **two numbers** as arguments and adds them together!

3. Friendly Parrot - This parrot greets people by returning their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).

4. Favorites Parrot - Tell this parrot about your three favorite things and it will return "I love too!" for each of them.
```python
#Example: If you write this line
favorites_parrot("bikes","cars","carrots")

#The output would be:
"I love bikes too!"
"I love cars too!"
"I love carrots too!"
```

5. Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrots so that they speak with letter cases swapped. How would you do that? 

6. The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps!
