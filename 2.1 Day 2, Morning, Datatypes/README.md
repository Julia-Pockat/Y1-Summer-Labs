# Datatypes Lab

Objective: In this lab, you will learn about different data types, including int, float, str, and bool, and how to use type() to determine what data type something is using Python in IDLE3. 



Instructions:
0. In Google Docs, at the top left of your screen, click File > Download as > Microsoft Word … so that you can edit this lab document.

1. Fill in column 2 of the table on the next page by writing what you would expect the output from Python to be. If you don't think Python can do something, write error. For example, if you did the first row, it would be like this:
 

Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
Expression
Your Guess
IDLE3 Output

integer
int









































2. 	 Open IDLE3  

3. 	In the Python shell, type the code from column 1 in each row, hit enter and write what the output is in column 3. Does it match what you thought the output would be? 

Bonus: 
1. Think about why you got the errors with some lines. How can you change the line to get no error? Discuss with you teammate next to you.  Test your guess in the Python shell! 

2. Now type all of the lines again without the word “type” at the beginning. What do you get?

3. If you have extra time, work on Unit 1 lab from yesterday or create your own design using turtle!
