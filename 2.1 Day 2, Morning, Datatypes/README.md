# Datatypes Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn about different data types, including `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`, and how to use `type()` to determine what data type a variable is, using **Python**.

> Before we start, make sure to create a new folder in **Repl.it** and call it **"Day 2"**!  
> In **"Day 2"**, create a new python file and call it **"DatatypesLab"**


## Instructions:

1. Pair up with a partner, and take a look at this table:
    - First row is done as an example!  
    
    **Expression** | **Your Guess** | **Output**
    --- | --- | ---
    `type(259+33)` | Integer | `int`
    `type(259-33.0)` |  | 
    `type(4)` |  | 
    `type('4')` |  | 
    `type('four')` |  | 
    `type(5/2.0)` |  |
    `type(12 > 2*5)` |  | 
    `type(color + 3)` |  |
    `type('color'*4)` |  | 

1. Go over each line with your partner, and try to guess what each line returns as an **output**... discuss what your guesses are!
    - If you don't think **Python** can do something, write `Error`.  

1. Now, after you're done guessing and discussing, let's put your theories to the test!
    - Try each line in **Repl.it** and understand why it is what it is.
    - If you don't understand something specific, try and ask your partner first :)





##### Great job!
##### Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks
 

If you have extra time, continue to the **Bonus Problems** *below*.  
If not, make sure your code is saved in **Repl.it**!

## Bonus Problems: 
1. Think about why you got the errors with some lines. How can you change the line to get no error? Discuss with you teammate next to you.  Test your guess in the **Repl.it** file! 

2. Now type all of the lines again without the word `type` at the beginning. What do you get?

3. If you have extra time, complete yesterday's lab(s) if you haven't OR create your *own design* using **turtle**!


##### Great job on completing the bonus problems section!  
###### Make sure your code is saved in Repl.it
