# Functions Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to start writing working **functions**, as well as use **inputs & outputs** a lot!

> Before we start, make sure to create a new folder in **Repl.it** and call it **"Day 4"**!  
> In **"Day 4"**, create a new python file and call it **"FunctionsLab"**


## Instructions:

### 1) Excited @MEET!
1. *Define* a new function and call it `excited`, it should take 1 argument which is `name`.

2. The function should **print**: `[name] is super excited to be at MEET!`

3. Let a neighbor try it out!


### 2) GO HOME!

Remember the **Go Home!** example we gave in the lecture?  

1. *Define* a new function and call it `goHome`, it should take 1 argument which is `name`.

2. The function should **print**: `[name], Go Home!`
    - What would be the output of `goHome("ah".capitalize() + "MAD".swapcase())`, and why? Discuss it with your partner!
    
3. Add an argument to the function called `hours`, and update the function to **print**: `[name], Go Home! But come back after [hours] hours.`

4. Test out your code! If it works, move on to the next part, if not, ask the help of a neighbor first :)


### 3) Restaurant Tip Calculator!

1. *Define* a new function and call it `tipCalc`, it should take 2 arguments:
    - `bill` - The table's bill
    - `percentage` - amount of percentage you would like to tip

2. The function should print how much you should tip!
    - For example, if you write `tipCalc(250,10)`, meaning the bill was `250`, and you want to give `10%` tip to the waiters, the output would be `Tip: 25`
    
3. Add another print statement in your **function**, it should print the **Total** of what you have to pay!

4. Add another argument to the function, call it `people`, it represents the number of people sitting at the table!

5. Add another print statement, it should print how much each person have to pay!

Parrots love to mimic their human companions. In this part you'll give your parrot **functions** a word or phrase as an **argument** and your parrot will take your argument, do something to it, and say then it back to you in their own quirky way.

Write the following functions according to each one's description:
1. Happy Parrot - This parrot is so happy. It accepts a 'thing' as its argument and then returns a string where it says how happy it is about the thing!  
    - Example: `happy_parrot(thing)` would return `"I am so happy about [thing]!"`

2. Math Parrot - Create a function that accepts **two numbers** as arguments and adds them together!

3. Friendly Parrot - This parrot greets people by returning their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).

4. Favorites Parrot - Tell this parrot about your three favorite things and he will return "I love too!" for each of them.
```python
#Example: If you write this line
favorites_parrot("bikes","cars","carrots")

#The output would be:
"I love bikes too!"
"I love cars too!"
"I love carrots too!"
```

5. Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrots so that they speak with letter cases swapped. How would you do that? 

6.The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps!
