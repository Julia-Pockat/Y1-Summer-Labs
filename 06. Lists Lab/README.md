> Before we start, make sure to create a new folder in **Repl.it** and call it **"Day 5"**!  
> In **"Day 5"**, create a new python file and call it **"ListsLab"**


## Instructions:

### 1) Warm Up!
1. *Create* a new list and call it `classmates`, and include all of the classmates you see around you in that list!
    - Example: `classmates = ["Loai", "Ahmad", "Celina", "Lyel", "Malak", "Shir"]`

2. Add your name to the list, using the `append()` function!

3. Check with a neighbor to make sure your list is correct!


### 2) Parking Valet!

You're working as a valet tonight at the **"Magic Palace"**! But, since you're a clever programmer, you decide to write a program that does your work for the night!  

1. *Define* a new list and call it `parked_cars`.
    - It should start as an empty list!

2. *Define* a new variable `car`, which uses `Input()` to take a string as the name of the car.
// *Define* a new function called `park`, it should take 1 argument - `car`

3. Write code to add the `car` to the `parked_cars` list!
    - And print `"Parked [car] in the garage!"`
    
4. Repeat this process as much as you'd like to add cars to your list.

Bonus:
1. *Define* a new variable called `car_to_remove` using the `Input()` function.
    - Your code should remove the `car_to_remove` from `parked_cars` list!
    - And print `"[car] is out of the garage and ready for use!"`
    - In case your chosen car is not there: You should reply with `"Your car is not in the garage!"`


### 3) Netflix!

Sometimes it's hard to keep up with your **Netflix *movie queue***. Sometimes, all you need is a Friday night to binge watch Friends.

We're going to use lists to manipulate our own movie Queue.


1. *Define* a function `first_movie` that returns the first movie in the queue. 
    - This function should accept a list as an argument (the `movie_queue`).


2. *Define* a function `watch_movie` that deletes the first movie in the list and returns the updated list.
    - This function should accept a list as an argument (the `movie_queue`).

3. *Define* a function `update_queue` that returns the updated list. 
    - This function takes **two** arguments:
        1. `movie_queue` - the list of movies.
        2. `movie` - the movie you want to add to the queue.
