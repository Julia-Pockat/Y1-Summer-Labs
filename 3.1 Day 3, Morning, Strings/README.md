# Strings & Conditionals Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to use **strings**, as well as make sure you grasp the idea of **Input/Output**!
Also, you will learn how to start writing conditions using conditionals and make programs that can take decisions!

> Before we start, make sure to create a **Repl.it** and call it **"Day 3"**.  
> And write your code in `main.py` file.

---

## Instructions:

### 1) Syntax: 
1. In the python editor, type `print('Hello World')` and hit **run**.  
    - What do you see?
    
2. Now type `print("Hello World")` and hit **run** again.
    - Did anything change?
    
3. Print "Hello" to your partner by including **his/her name**.
    - For example `"Hello Claire"`. 
    - Show it to them!

4. Now type `#print("Hello World")` and hit **run**.
    - What happens when you run the code? 
    - **Answer:** You have just made a **comment**. Python does not read anything after the `#` symbol (but people looking at your code do).

---
### 2) Input Output : 
1. In the **python editor**, make a **variable** called `sentence1` that takes **input** from the user, like this:
```python
sentence1 = input("Say something! ")
```

2. **Run** your code, and test it out if it's working properly so far!

3. Create another **variable** and call it `sentence2`, that works just like `sentence1`.

4. After the user gives input to the 2 variables (`sentence1` and `sentence2`), make it print both sentences in 1 line.
    - Example: 
    - Let's say `sentence1` was `"Hello, my name is "`
    - And `sentence2` was `"Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`
    - It should print `"Hello, my name is Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`

---
### 3) Operators: 

1. Copy paste this code into your **Repl.it** editor:
```python
s1 = " together until we "
s2 = " all the same."
s3 = "Let's all be unique "
s4 = " realise we are " 
```

2. Using the string operations, put these sentences together to complete the meaning!

### 4) Homer Diet
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/homer.gif" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> Homer Simpson has decided to go on a diet and he needs your help to stay on track. You are going to make the tests pass and help him control his donut intake.   

1. *Define* a new variable called `number_of_donuts` and set it to whatever `integer` you want. Write a program that does the following: 
    - If the **number of donuts** is *greater* than **zero**, then this program should **print** `"Get back on your diet!"` 
    - Otherwise it should **print** `"Good job, Homer!"`
    
- Homer's diet has been going well and we're going to cut him some slack. 
2. Using our variable from before (`number_of_donuts`). Write another program the does the following:
    - The function should tell Homer `"good job"` when he eats **less than *3 donuts***
    - And to `"slow down"` if he's eaten **exactly 3 donuts** 
    - And `"get back on your diet"` if he eats **more than 3 donuts**.

- We've decided to give Homer a little more control over his diet.  
3. *Define* a new variable called `maximum_donuts`. While still using our variable from before (`number_of_donuts`), Write another program the does the following: 
    - Tell Homer `"good job"` if he eats **less than half his maximum donuts**
    - And `"get back on your diet"` when he **exceeds his maximum donuts**.
        - Meaning: If homer has eaten more donuts than his `maximum_donuts`.

## Bonus Problems:

### Daily Routine Program

Homer's daily routine is:
- 8-9 Wake up
- 9-10 Brush teeth, then eat 10 donuts.
- 10-12 Run to the store and make sure you have enough donuts for lunch.
- 12-13 Donuts Lunch
- 13-15 Go to the park
- 15-19 TV Time!
- 19-20 Donuts Dinner!
- 20-24 Fall asleep while watching TV and eating donuts.

1. Write a program that takes 1 `input` from the user called `time`, it represents the hour.
    - You can do this by typing: `time = input("What time is it? ")`

2. Plan the program and make it so when the users puts in `time`, it would print Homer's task according to the daily routine plan of his!
    - For example: `What time is it? 13` would return as an output: `Donuts Lunch`
    
3. Does it work properly? Test it out!
 
4. Now, ask your parent/sibling to write down his/her daily routine, and write a new program that does the same, but for the new routine!
    - Let your parent/sibling try it out!
