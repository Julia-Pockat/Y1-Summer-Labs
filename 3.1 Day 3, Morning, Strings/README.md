## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to use **strings**, as well as make sure you grasp the idea of **Input/Output**!

> And create a new file and call it **"Strings1Lab"**.

## Instructions:

### 1) Syntax: 
1. In the python editor, type `print('Hello World')` and hit **run**.  
    - What do you see?
    
2. Now type `print("Hello World")` and hit **run** again.
    - Did anything change?
    
3. Print "Hello" to your partner by including **his/her name**.
    - For example `"Hello Claire"`. 
    - Show it to them!

4. Now type `#print("Hello World")` and hit **run**.
    - What happens when you run the code? 
    - **Answer:** You have just made a **comment**. Python does not read anything after the `#` symbol (but people looking at your code do).

---
### 2) Input Output : 
1. In the **python editor**, make a **variable** called `sentence1` that takes **input** from the user, like this:
```python
sentence1 = input("Say something! ")
```

2. **Run** your code, and test it out if it's working properly so far!

3. Create another **variable** and call it `sentence2`, that works just like `sentence1`.

4. After the user gives input to the 2 variables (`sentence1` and `sentence2`), make it print both sentences in 1 line.
    - Example: 
    - Let's say `sentence1` was `"Hello, my name is "`
    - And `sentence2` was `"Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`
    - It should print `"Hello, my name is Loai, and I'm 15 years old!"`

---
### 3) Operators: 

1. Copy paste this code into your **Repl.it** editor:
```python
s1 = " together until we "
s2 = " all the same."
s3 = "Let's all be unique "
s4 = " realise we are " 
```

2. Using the string operations, put these sentences together to complete the meaning!
